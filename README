To Do
greg + sam - Store
Kieran - checkout
Chris - file handling
Alex - customer

From Alex: Having had a quick peek into the package.bluej file, it's standard text encoding, so just pop it open with your favourite text editing program as it just contains settings for the interface such as dependencies of classes etc. To save merging changes, you can run 
	git reset SuperSim/package.bluej
That way, it won't be included in commits, but the file will remain and therefore we shouldn't have any conflicts. I've also branched the repo so I can make some tweaks and push them so I have another copy somewhere.
Also, something I neglected to notice, is that running
	git add -A
	git add --all
will not only update the list of files to be committed, but it will also remove deleted files from GIT's internal indexy thingy. Remember to run
	git reset SuperSim/package.bluej
after running any git command which adds all files in the directory.

Alex: The file handler is throwing nasties at me when I try and use the items.txt file.
@Alex, fixed problem. It was a bad git setting adding blank lines to the text file. ~Greg

To DO ASAP!!!

*1. Total time in store incl queue. ** Why does this need doing again? Averages for store + queue can be simple addition at end. ~G
*2. ticks start from 0 at midnight pass hour to customer from store ** Hour now passed from controller to customers constructor. Will leave to Alex to finish ~Greg ** Finished ~Alex
*3. Biased probability of customer type ** Finished, although probabilities are currently arbitrary pending research ~Alex
*4. Text file writing ** Done
*5. JavaDoc the lot ** Done
*6. Research ** Fuck it
7. Report & other doc
8. Graphics.
*9. Chris to finish item list. **Done ~Chris
*10. Loyalty card ** Finished
*10a. Stats daisy chaining ** sort of done ~Greg

*11: PERFORMANCE!: Every 1000 hours, dump arraylist to txt file instead of writing every item.
