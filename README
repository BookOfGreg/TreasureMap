From Alex: Having had a quick peek into the package.bluej file, it's standard text encoding, so just pop it open with your favourite text editing program. To save merging changes, you can run 
	git rm SuperSim/package.bluej
That way, it won't be included in commits and therefore we shouldn't have any conflicts. I've also branched the repo so I can make some tweaks and push them so I have another copy somewhere.
